      "aboutMe": "It’s my joy in life to experiment, try new things, and explore possibilities. My time in account management brought such opportunities, for which I am forever grateful. Through working with international organizations, I was able to visit exciting places and get to know interesting people from all over the world. I found the innovation of bringing together clients’ ideas and a team’s imagination both thrilling and rewarding. What’s more, I was fascinated by this mysterious leap from conception to execution; there was always that point at which the ideas would go off to development and soon after had evolved into a real product. Over time I only grew more intrigued by what happens between idea and materialization. Being given the opportunity to find out for myself has been the most fulfilling endeavor of my career. Continually learning software development empowers me every day because through it, people come together in real and meaningful ways. Technology helps bridge gaps across geography and generations, and playing a part in that is both an adventure and a privilege.",
